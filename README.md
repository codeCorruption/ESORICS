# HoneywordsM
Here we provide implementations related to the paper "A Secure Honeywords System Despite a Code-Corrupted Login Server"; submission in 2017.

In this paper we propose a protocol to keep a Honeywords System working (i.e., detecting when password files are leaked) in the case that an intruder corrupts the login server's code.

The code corresponding to formal verifications of the extended version "A Critical Security Analysis of the Password-based Authentication Honeywords System Under Code-Corruption Attack" is also mantained here.
