# HoneywordsM
Here we provide implementations related to the paper "A Secure Honeywords System Despite a Code-Corrupted Login Server"; published in Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy, ICISSP 2018.

In that paper we propose a protocol to keep a Honeywords System working (i.e., detecting when password files are leaked) in the case that an intruder corrupts the login server's code.

The code corresponding to formal verifications performed in the extended version "A Critical Security Analysis of the Password-based Authentication Honeywords System Under Code-Corruption Attack" is also mantained here.
