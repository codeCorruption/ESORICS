# HoneywordsM
Implementations related to the paper "A Secure Honeywords System Despite a Code-Corrupted Login Server"; submission in 2017.

In this paper we propose a protocol to keep a Honeywords System working (i.e., detecting when password files are leaked) in the case that an intruder corrupts the login server's code.
